                    <p>
                        In the similar server we played before there were things that we really hated, so we decided
                        they should never exist in our
                        server.
                        <br> 1. Admins should not consider themselves as something more than the players and should not
                        be arrogant.
                        <br> 2. The players should be allowed freedom of speech without being censored.
                        <br> 3. No admins are allowed to directly change the map. Not even Head Admins.
                        <br> 4. Players must be able to become VIP for free.
                        <br> 5. Hooks will never be added in this server!

                        the
                        server crashed a lot, but that didn't stop players to join again. New admins ware appointed to
                        keep
                        things under control and everyone had fun pissing around on everybody or all over the map!

                    <h2>The Fall of 500 Kills for VIP</h2>
                    <p>
                        A new plugin was introduced to help bring new players to the empty server at the time. It gives
                        players free VIP automatically
                        after they reach 500 kills. It was a good idea at first and everything was fine for a time, but
                        then
                        the server became overflooded with VIPs, many of which ware kids with toxic behavior. Something
                        needed
                        to be changed so we can

                            big problem</a> occurs, which was in the face of Neiko. After he became Admin by SMS he was
                        reported for abusing his power. Neikooo banned another player for 15 minutes because the player
                        called
                        him "noob". After that event, LOLUMAD stated constantly to harass him even though he was
                        already
                        punished.

                            <br>The struggle</a> was real and immediate action was necessary to keep the server under
                        control.
                        The controversy ended with both Neikooo and Lolumad being punished. Neikoo has been turned into
                        Premium
                        VIP and LOLUMAD has lost his Admin rights for a week.

                    <p>
                        After the events with Neikooo it became clear that we need to have some order in the server,
                        without abusing our power as
                        authorities and at the same time keeping the freedom that we promised to have since the
                        creation
                        of the server. It was about time, a new RULES to take place in order to keep everyone in check.

                    <h2>The Civil War</h2>
                    <p> It was late January. Lolumad reached the highest level of toxicity after the new innovations
                        Maverick
                        made to the server. Refusing to accept any of the new changes, he turned against Maverick and
                        started
                        to lead his "supporters" in the forum to help him prove his point. Didn't take long for things
                        to
                        escalate with Lolumad turning against the other admins - starting with Saad, Nojarq and
                        Head|Roller.
                        <br> The server was on the brink of a Civil War divided between The Admins and Lolumad with his
                        gang
                        members. After *Mr.Fantastic* presented new evidence against Lolumad's behavior, the admin side
                        prevailed
                        and his rebellion was overthrown. After these events, some of Lolumad's gang members
                        disappeared,
                        *Mr.Fantastic* was promoted to admin due to the part he played for ending the war and the
                        server
                        was once again peaceful place... for some time.

                    <p>Once again we had a big crysis with giving too much power in the hands of the unworthy. Ammar
                        was the
                        prime example that players shouldn't be given power. Premium VIP was a mistake from the
                        beginning
                        and Ammar with his abusive behaviour shows that.The VIP needs to be changed. Since the last
                        Admin
                        Council with Nojarq it
                        <a target="_blank" href="http://awesomecs.syntrwave.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=898">was decided</a>
                        we will never do this mistake again. The whole VIP system has been reworked.</p>
